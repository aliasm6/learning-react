#### I will be following and recording my progress.

#### Key Terms:

1. Element - React's most primitive data type. "Chunks of data that describe how to build a UI. Think of them as low level instructions; the assembly of React."
Example:
```javascript
const example = React.createElement("type",[props],[...children]);
```

1. React - The standard library

1. ReactDOM - The rendering engine

1. Components - Chunks of React elements that represent a common behavior
